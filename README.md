# Fairseal 🦭

**Provably fair selections for games, loot boxes, and any randomized allocation.**

Fairseal creates verifiable receipts (CSRs) proving that a selection was committed before the outcome was knowable. Every loot drop, gacha pull, and randomized selection — independently verifiable, trustlessly.

## Try It Now

```bash
npx @fairseal/commit
```

One command. A verifiable gacha pull in your terminal. No setup.

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install @fairseal/commit
```

```typescript
import { createCommitment, resolveCommitment, createReceipt, verifyReceipt } from '@fairseal/commit';

// 1. Lock your loot table BEFORE the outcome is knowable
const commitment = createCommitment({
  rule: JSON.stringify(LOOT_TABLE),
  inputs: [playerId, pullNumber.toString()],
  revealAfter: 10,
});

// 2. Resolve with verifiable entropy from drand
const resolution = await resolveCommitment(commitment);

// 3. Your algorithm + verifiable entropy = provably fair drop
const drop = yourWeightedPull(LOOT_TABLE, resolution.beaconRandomness);

// 4. Package as a receipt anyone can verify
const receipt = createReceipt(commitment, resolution);
const proof = await verifyReceipt(receipt); // ✅ PARTIAL
```

## How It Works

1. **Commit** — Lock your drop table + player ID into a hash before the randomness exists
2. **Entropy** — Wait for a public drand beacon round (Cloudflare + Protocol Labs)
3. **Resolve** — Derive the selection from beacon entropy + your committed rule
4. **Verify** — Anyone can re-run every step. BLS12-381 cryptographic verification. No trust required.

## Performance

| Operation | Time |
|---|---|
| Commitment creation | **0.006ms** (170,000+/sec) |
| Beacon fetch | **~200ms** |
| BLS verification | **~150ms** |
| Receipt size | **0.9 KB** |

Client-side. No server. No account. No fees for PARTIAL verification.
